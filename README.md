#HOPERISE Application

The Polyclinic Management application "HOPERISE" provides a comprehensive system for managing a polyclinic, facilitating access to various services and functionalities for both patients and staff. It allows users to browse available services, schedule appointments, manage profiles, and leave reviews, thus improving communication and organization within the polyclinic.

This application is valuable as it simplifies the process of accessing healthcare services for patients while enabling polyclinic staff to efficiently manage appointments, medical records, and services, resulting in improved quality of healthcare provision.

Users can get started with the application by installing the necessary dependencies, running, and accessing it through a web browser. They can then explore various functionalities such as viewing services, scheduling appointments, and managing profiles.

Maintenance and contributions to this project are carried out by a dedicated team of development engineers ensuring regular updates, improvements, and support for the application.
